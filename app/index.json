Adopted in 2015 by all UN member states, the 17 goals are part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, providing a blueprint for addressing the world's most pressing challenges. The SDGs are interconnected, balancing economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. They aim to create a fairer, more sustainable world by promoting inclusive development, reducing inequalities, and tackling issues like climate change and environmental degradation, ensuring that no one is left behind."
