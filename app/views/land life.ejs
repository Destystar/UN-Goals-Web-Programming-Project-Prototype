      <p id="Summary">
        Protecting our planet's ecosystems is vital for biodiversity and the
        health of life on land. This goal seeks to halt deforestation, restore
        degraded lands, and promote the sustainable use of natural resources. By
        preserving forests and combating desertification, we not only protect
        wildlife but also strengthen ecosystems that support human life and
        mitigate climate change.
